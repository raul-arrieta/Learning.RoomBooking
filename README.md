Room Booking System

This is me just learning by doing.
The idea is to create an angular2 app that works both as asp.net core server and electron desktop client, and add some kind of realtime notifications by using signalr.

IÂ´ll be using Entity Framework Core to handle model in memory database...

Do not even consider this as a final product or use it in production environments.
